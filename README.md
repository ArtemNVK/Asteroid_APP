<p>Asteroid_APP is a web application that allows users to not only browse but also learn about all registered asteroids at one place. This application fetches data on asteroids through interaction with one of the NASA's RESTful APIs - NeoWS (Near Earth Object Web Service).</p>
<p>Web app’s structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Welcome page;</li>
<li>Asteroids Browser. This page displays rows of asteroid cards – every card contains overall data about particular asteroid. Asteroids can be filtered based on whether they are hazardous or not (that is, might collide with Earth’s orbit) and whether their next closest approach is within next 20 years. Featuring numeric pagination.</li>
<li>Asteroid details. This page fetches data about particular asteroid by its ID and displays its detailed data.</li> 
<li>Not Found Page.</li>
</ol> 
<p>This application features tooltips next to scientific terms that are aimed to educate users on the subject matter.</p>
